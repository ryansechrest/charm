/**
 * Adds persistence state tracking to a model.
 *
 * A model, like `Post` or `User`, will immediately persist changes to the
 * database via one of its persistence methods, such as `create()` or
 * `update()`.
 *
 * When a model (e.g. `Post`) changes other models (e.g. `Meta`), we may want to
 * defer persisting changes to `Meta` models until a persistence method on the
 * `Post` model is called.
 *
 * This avoids having to manually call a persistence method on each `Meta` model
 * and ensures that `Meta` models don't change before the `Post` model.
 *
 * We achieve this by tracking the persistence state within each `Meta` model
 * and calling a unified `persist()` method, which automatically invokes the
 * appropriate persistence method based on the modelâ€™s state.
